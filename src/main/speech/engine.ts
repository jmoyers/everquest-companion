// engine.ts — main's side of the Kokoro tier: the cache, the dedupe, and one warm worker.
//
// THE DIVISION OF LABOUR. `worker.ts` knows how to turn text into a wav. This file knows
// WHEN that is worth doing, and it is the only thing that ever asks:
//
//   speech:say {text, voiceId}
//        │
//        ├─ hash = sha256(voiceId \0 text)
//        ├─ <userData>/speech-cache/<hash>.wav on disk?  ──yes──►  eqspeech://<hash>   (0 ms)
//        ├─ tier not installed?                          ──yes──►  {ok:false}          (0 ms)
//        ├─ already being synthesized?                    ──yes──►  join that promise
//        └─ else: spawn-or-reuse the worker, queue the job, await, then serve the url
//
// EVERY BRANCH ABOVE EXISTS TO NOT RUN THE MODEL. The cache is permanent (D3), so the steady
// state of a long play session is branch one: a phrase said for the thousandth time costs a
// file read. The dedupe covers the case that actually happens in this app — three buffs
// fading at once, all resolving to the same word — which without it would be three concurrent
// model runs producing three identical files.
//
// THE WORKER IS LAZY AND THEN WARM. Nothing spawns at startup: a user who never enables voice
// alerts never pays for onnxruntime being on disk, let alone loaded. The first cache MISS
// spawns it, and it stays for the life of the app, holding the ~90 MB session and the 28 MB
// voice pack — which is why the second uncached phrase is ~0.9 s instead of ~1.6 s.
//
// A DEAD WORKER STAYS DEAD (politely). If the thread cannot start at all — the native module
// failed to load in a packaged build, say — that is a property of the installation, not of
// this request. It is recorded ONCE and every later call answers `{ok:false}` immediately
// rather than re-attempting a failing spawn per alert. `{ok:false}` is the fallback seam W2
// already handles: the alert is spoken by the system voice, and the user hears their alert.
//
// ELECTRON-FREE ON PURPOSE. `userData` and the worker path are injected, so this module can
// be constructed in a test (and so that ipc/speech.ts stays the only place that knows about
// `app`). The same rule imageCache.ts follows.
