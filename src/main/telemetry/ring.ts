// telemetry/ring.ts — `<userData>/telemetry.json`, the local event ring.
//
// TWO HALVES, split for the same reason `storeMigrations.ts` splits its runner from its file
// I/O: the RING ITSELF is pure and node-testable (`pushCapped`, `parseRingFile`), and the file
// half is a thin, Electron-dependent shell over it.
//
// WHY NOT electron-store (a decision, not an oversight — the same one feedback/state.ts made):
// the store-migration law exists so the SETTINGS file written by any past build loads in
// today's build, indefinitely. Buffered telemetry is disposable by design — the whole feature
// is "counts we would like to have" — and paying the migration tax for it would be wrong twice
// over. So: its own file, its own tiny `version` integer, corrupt ⇒ start from empty.
//
// The user's PREFERENCES (enabled / noticeShown / analyticsId) do live in the settings store,
// behind schema migration 5 → 6, because those are not disposable: forgetting that a user
// turned analytics off would be the worst bug this feature could have.
//
// Everything resolves through `app.getPath('userData')`, so channel.ts's decision redirects it
// automatically: the dev app, the installed app and an e2e run can never share a ring.
