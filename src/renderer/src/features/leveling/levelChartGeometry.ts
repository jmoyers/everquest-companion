// tests/levelHover.test.mts can import it straight under tsx (there is no `@shared/*`
// alias in the node test runner — see AGENTS.md / the hover plan's D6).

// Why it exists: `AreaChart` and `LevelStepChart` each used to compute `t0/t1/pad`
// inline. A hover readout derived from a second copy of that arithmetic can silently
// disagree with the pixels it is pointing at. One mapping, one source.
