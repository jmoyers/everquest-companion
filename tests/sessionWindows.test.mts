// SESSION-FRAME TESTS — login/logout in the world model.
//
// Three layers, in the order the model was built:
//
//   1. PARSER GOLDENS over real, scrubbed log windows (tests/fixtures/s1–s5-session-*.log, cut
//      by tests/extract-session-fixtures.mjs): the three new line families, byte-exact.
//
//   2. OFFLINE-GAP GOLDENS: the same windows replayed through the real parser + the real
//      SessionDetector, pinning every field of every derived `offlineGap`. These windows were
//      chosen to cover the four outcomes the log actually contains — an overnight camp, a
//      crash with no camp at all, a pair of ABORTED camps (the only two in the log), and a
//      sub-minute relog that must produce nothing.
//
//   3. BUFF-TIMER PAUSE: first the EVIDENCE (fixture s5, a real cast/camp/login/wear-off
//      chain whose arithmetic can only be explained by timers that stop while you are out of
//      the world), then the CONTRACT it justifies, driven through BuffsModule with
//      hand-built events so the pause and the mining censor are pinned independently of the
//      30-minute log hole that would otherwise mask them.
//
// WHAT THE MODEL DOES ABOUT ALL THIS lives next door in tests/buffPauseOffline.test.mts —
// JOS-134's half: that a buff survives a real overnight camp (the case layer 3 could not reach,
// because the hole used to wipe it before the gap arrived), and that a DEBUFF pointedly does not
// pause with it.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
